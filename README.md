## Minimal Exam Statistics Canister with Basic Functions
This is my first ever created canister using Rust ic-cdk.

Commands for running locally:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background
```
```bash
# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```
Then choose the second link provided in the terminal.
