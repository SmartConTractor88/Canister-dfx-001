## Minimal exam statistics canister with basic functions
This is my first ever created canister using Rust ic-cdk.

Commands for running locally:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background
```
```bash
# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```
